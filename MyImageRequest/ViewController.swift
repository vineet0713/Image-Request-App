 Notes:
 
 URLSession is a class that can manage network requests on our behalf!

 We can create our own URLSession with custom settings,
 or we can use the shared URLSession that comes preloaded with default settings

 (the shared session is known as a Singleton, which is an object that can only be instantiated once)
 (this shared session will be referring to the SAME object in multiple Swift files throughout the app!)

 For custom URLSessions, we can use the URLSessionConfiguration class
 (which allows us to change things like the amount of time to wait for a network request before cancelling it)


 network requests are known as "tasks" in URLSession
 any task used by URLSession is a subclass of URLSessionTask
 3 main tasks we work with:
      Data (URLSessionDataTask) returns data from the network directly into memory as Data objects (good for short-lived requests!)
      Download (URLSessionDownloadTask) returns data from the network into a temporary file
      Upload (URLSessionUploadTask) are specialized for uploading content
 
 
 
 the URLSession doesn't directly run tasks for us - instead, it gives us methods to create tasks (we have to start the tasks ourselves)
